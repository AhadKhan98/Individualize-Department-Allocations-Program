# Individualize Department Allocations Program
### Author: Ahad Zai
## Functionality
Using the department allocations excel file, this script creates a word file for each department in the allocations file. The word file contains a color-coded table which has infromation such as number of primary and secondary positions and hours available for break periods. These individual word files can then be placed into each department's respective box folder.
## Instructions
1) Add the text files to the working directory
2) Download the python script and run it
3) Two new text files (master_file.txt) and (log.txt) will be created. 
**NOTE:** The log.txt will display the number of lines copied from each text file. The total number might be one less than the original as the script does not include the header row.
